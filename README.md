# Retail-Customer-Behavioral-Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on consumer behavior. The goal is to analyze spending patterns, income impact, campaign effectiveness, and customer complaints using Python and statistical methods.

## Dataset
The project integrates three datasets:
- **Demographics Data**: Includes consumer age, income, and household details.
- **Behavior Data**: Tracks spending on various product categories.
- **Campaign Data**: Records responses to marketing campaigns.

## Key Insights
1. **Spending vs Campaign Response**: Customers who responded to campaigns tend to have higher spending in specific categories.
2. **Funnel Analysis**: Certain campaigns were more effective in converting customers.
3. **Income Impact on Spending**: Higher income correlates with increased spending on select products.
4. **Complaints vs Recency**: Customers who lodged complaints exhibit different engagement patterns.
5. **Campaign Overlap**: There is a correlation between acceptance of different campaigns.
